# Build Log

Course: DBIZ3 AI-native Product Development, Sessions 8 to 11
Team: `G`    Product: `Hanoi Artisan Bridge`

Save as `docs/build/build-log.md`. Add one entry for every agent run that created or changed a
file in `specs/`, `src/` (or your code folder) or `tests/`. Write it right after the run, not at
the end of the day. The build log is how the instructors, and your teammates, see what the agent
did and what the humans decided.

## 1. Features in progress

| Feature folder | Module | User stories in this slice | Owner | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `specs/001-exp-core` | EXP | US-1 Browse Explore (P1) | Group G, human reviewer pending | `001-exp-core` | Local prototype; review needed |

## 2. Run entries

Copy this block for each run. Keep the newest entry at the bottom.

### Entry `<n>`: `<dd/mm>` `<member>`

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Path and agent | A (Claude Code) / B (Antigravity agent, model `<name>`) |
| Command and argument | `/speckit-plan ...` (paste the argument you typed) |
| Feature and tasks | `specs/001-...`, tasks `T0xx` to `T0yy` |
| What the agent produced | files created or changed, one line each |
| Human review | Accepted / Changed / Rejected. What you changed and why |
| Tests | `<passed> passed, <failed> failed` (paste the last line of the test run) |
| Spec issues found | none / open question `<n>` added to `docs/spec/spec-<MODULE>.md` |
| Commit | `<first 7 characters of the hash>` |

### Entry 1: 13/10 Codex — prepare, plan, tasks and analyze

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Path and agent | Local Codex agent using Session 8 Spec Kit workflow |
| Command and argument | `start_feature.py --spec docs/spec/specs/spec-EXP.md EXP --name core`; plan US-1 P1 only; tasks require tests before code; read-only analyze |
| Feature and tasks | `specs/001-exp-core`, T001–T018 |
| What the agent produced | `spec.md` snapshot, `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/explore-api.md`, `quickstart.md`, `tasks.md` |
| Human review | Pending. Plan follows existing TypeScript/Next/Vitest stack and uses the canonical seed read-only. |
| Tests | `start_feature.py --check`: OK; environment check: 0 FAIL, 0 WARN |
| Spec issues found | See section 3: media files missing; later EXP analytics fields need data-model clarification. |
| Commit | Local commit on `001-exp-core`; not pushed |

### Entry 2: 13/10 Codex — US-1 tests first, code and verify

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Path and agent | Local Codex agent |
| Command and argument | Setup, US-1 tests first, then catalog/API/UI code; no spec or data edits |
| Feature and tasks | `specs/001-exp-core`, T001–T018 |
| What the agent produced | Next.js scaffold; seeded catalog service and API; Guest/Agency browse UI; minimal detail and Login destinations; unit/integration tests; `.gitignore` build-output rules |
| Human review | Pending. Agency Quote/Chat handoff and full detail remain separate stories. |
| Tests | Red: 2 suites could not import missing code. Green: 7 tests passed, 0 failed; `npm run lint` passed; `npm run build` passed; seed validator passed (47 CSVs); Guest/API/development Agency demo checked in browser. |
| Spec issues found | No P1 entity attribute missing. The seed records image keys but not image binary objects; cards use placeholders. Full §5.1 check identifies later-story persistence gaps below. |
| Commit | Local commit on `001-exp-core`; not pushed |

## 3. Spec issues found while building

Every gap the build uncovers goes back to `docs/spec/` as an open question or a spec change. It
is never fixed silently in code.

| # | Found at (step, entry) | Issue | Where it went in the spec | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | |
| 1 | Prepare / Entry 1 | FR-006 detail visit fields (`entered_at`, `exited_at`, `scroll_depth_pct`, `sections_viewed`, `next_action`, `time_to_next_action`, `detail_visit_log_id`) have no explicit logical entity/columns in `data/`; FR-007 `source_context` is also not explicit. | No source change made; data keeper must decide a storage mapping before US-2. | Open; outside US-1 |
| 2 | Prepare / Entry 1 | FR-003 optional `included_items`/`excluded_items` have no explicit Experience columns, and stored image binaries are absent though media metadata exists. | No source change made; PRF/EXP owners should clarify before full US-4 detail. | Open; outside US-1 |
| 3 | Analyze / Entry 2 | US-1 AC2 says Agency actions are available, but the Quote/Chat handoff belongs to F-EXPLORE-11/12 and is not built in this slice. | Documented in `specs/001-exp-core/plan.md`; UI says unavailable and does not present a broken Agency button. | Open; blocks claiming complete US-1 acceptance |
| 4 | Install / Entry 2 | The package versions match the existing AIT stack but `npm audit` reports 9 dependency advisories, including 3 critical. | No source spec change; upgrade the shared stack with the other module branches before external deployment. | Open; prototype only |

## 4. Agent mistakes worth remembering

Short notes for the team and for Session 10 (debugging and code review): what the agent got
wrong, how you noticed, and what you changed in the prompt, `AGENTS.md` or the constitution so it
does not happen again.

| Entry | What went wrong | How it was caught | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |
| 2 | EXP / local preview | Running `npm run build` while `npm run dev` used the same `.next` directory invalidated a development server chunk and made `/explore` return HTTP 500. | `next.config.mjs` now separates development output (`.next-dev`) from production output (`.next`); verified a production build while dev served `/explore` successfully. |
